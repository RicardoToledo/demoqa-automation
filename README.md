#### Directly running the suite with Testcafe command

To run the test suite with different settings or to specify fixtures or tests please refer to [Testcafe's Run Tests documentation](https://testcafe.io/documentation/402830/guides/basic-guides/run-tests).

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions
The project integrates [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) as its CI/CD platform.

A workflow is already integrated into this repo which automates a full test run in an [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) virtual machine every time a pull request is created for the `main` branch.

The `.yml` file with the setup can be found in this repo's path: [.github/workflows/ui-test-automation.yml](.github/workflows/ui-test-automation.yml)

#### Results in [Calliope.Pro](https://www.calliope.pro/)
During each workflow's execution and as a final step a test report in JSON format will be uploaded to the Calliope.Pro profile:
> Ricardo's Qualification Assignment > UI Assignment - demoqa.com > demoqa.com automation test

A public example of a report generated by this GitHub Actions workflow can be found here:
